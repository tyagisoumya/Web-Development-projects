This is a simple web-based PDF merging tool called PdfX, designed to allow users to upload and merge multiple PDF files effortlessly.
 Built using Node.js, Express, Multer, and pdf-merger-js, the tool provides an intuitive interface with Bootstrap styling. 
Users can select two or more PDF files, upload them through the form, and receive a merged PDF as output. 

This Node.js function, mergePdfs, utilizes the pdf-merger-js library to merge two PDF files. It first creates an instance of PDFMerger, 
then adds the provided PDF files (p1 and p2) to the merger. The merged PDF is saved to the public/merged.pdf file, making it accessible for download. 
Additionally, the function deletes the original uploaded PDFs using fs.unlinkSync to free up storage space. This implementation ensures efficient and automated PDF merging for users.
